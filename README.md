# Rent-Prediction-of-House

This project of mine predicts room rent in metropolitan city in which BHK , Rent, Size, Floor, Area Type, Area Locality, City, Furnishing Status, Tenant Preferred, Bathroom are the feature input columns. Along with this, I plotted many visualizations like countplot, scatterplot, which made it easier for me to understand the dataset. I first dropped the outliers from the dataset so that my model performance does not deteriorate. Then I used OneHotencoing and OrdinalEncoding in categorical features and transformed them into numerical format. While using OneHotEncoding, I used drop='first' property which removed many of my features and increased the working efficiency of the algorithm. Then I trained the model and calculated its r2_score which gave me I got 55.9%, then to rehack it I calculated cross_val_score
